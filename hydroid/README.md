This directory contains the sources of the Android port of HyperRogue.

You should copy the sound and music files from HyperRogue's main directory to
the directories here; this is done by the script `copy.sh`.

The 'low quality' versions of music files are already in their location (copying them
is uncommented in copy.sh).
